# CICD
## Docker
- Virtualization platform to containerise your app. Continuous Integration Efficiency with Dcoker enables you to build a container image and use that same image across every step of the deployment process. 
- A huge benefit of this is to seperate non dependent steps and run them in parallel. 

## Continuous Integration
- Developers merge/commit code to master branch multiple times a day, fully automated build and test process which gives feedback within minutes, this avoids integration problems that usually occur when people wait for release day to merge thier changes into the release branch.

## Continuous Delivery
- An extension of continuous integration to make sure that you can release new changes to your customers quickly in a sustainable way. Therefore on top of having automated testing, the release process has also been automated so you can deploy your app at any point of time by clicking a button. In continuous delivery the deployment is completed manually. 

## Continuous Deployment 
- Every change that passes all satges of production pipeline is released to your customers, there is no human intervention and only a failed test will prevent new change to be deployed to production. 

## CI/CD Pipeline
- All about automation, initiating code builds, automated testing and automated deployment to the staging or production environments. This is incredibly fast, if the output of any stage fails then the next stage will also fail.
